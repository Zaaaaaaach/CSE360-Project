If You Forget Me by Pablo Neruda I want you to know one thing. You know how
this is: if I look at the crystal moon, at the red branch of the slow autumn
at my window, if I touch near the fire the impalpable ash or the wrinkled body
of the log, everything carries me to you, as if everything that exists, aromas
, light, metals, were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that
wait for me.
